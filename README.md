Hungry Games
============

Evolutionary tournaments have been widely used as a tool for comparing strategies, however game theorists are still in need for a
common tool (application) to conduct complex tournaments. In fact, there still doesn't exist a commonly used application for conducting and analysing complex round-robin and evolutionary tournaments.
With the help of “Hungry Games” application a user can choose any combination among the given games and strategies and conduct a round robin as well as an evolutionary tournament for a chosen number of rounds. Besides, based on the results of the tournament application automatically
generates and shows players' average payoff matrix and evolutionary tournament graph.


DEVELOPMENT
============

Hungry Games is a collaborative project. You are welcome to submit pull requests although if you plan to put a non-trivial amount of work into coding new features, it is recommended that you first contact me before that. The enhancement of this application will include creating more complex executable and web-based applications, which will allow to add and modify games/strategies
dynamically.
