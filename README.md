<h1>About</h1>

Evolutionary tournaments have been long used as a method for comparing strategies in Multi Agent systems, however, there still doesn't exist a commonly adopted tool for conducting and analysing complex evolutionary/round-robin tournaments. HungryGames is a simple <b>simulator with GUI</b>, written in Python, that allows a user to choose any combination among the given games and strategies and <b>conduct round robin as well as evolutionary tournaments</b> for a specified number of rounds. Based on the results, the application will <b>generate and visualize</b> players' average payoff matrix and evolutionary tournament graph.

<h1>Content</h1>
This respository containts the Python implementation of the HungryGames application. 

<h1>Installation</h1>
Just download the files and install the dependencies (PyQT) if required. Please contact me if you face any difficulties with the installation or have any questions/comments regarding the code. 

<h1>Usage</h1>
To use the application simply run the following command

```
python hungrygamesmain.py
``` 

which will initiate the GUI.

<h1>Development and Contributions</h1>

Hungry Games is a collaborative project. The future releases of this application will be dedicated to creating more advanced executable and its <b>web-based version</b>, which will allow to <b>add and modify games/strategies dynamically</b>.

You are more than welcome to submit pull requests. Although, if you plan to put a non-trivial amount of work into coding new features, it is recommended that you first contact me.
